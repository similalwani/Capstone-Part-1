# Localizing the origin of ventricular activation from 12-Lead ECG using Domain Generalization
The aim of this project is to develop a domain generalized model to localize the origin of ventricular contractions, using domain invariant patient data generalized and adapted using DANN (Domain Adversarial Neural Network).

## Dataset:
Dataset cannot be made public, so I've provided the executed code with outputs in an .ipynb file. The dataset consists of simulated ECG wave forms for 3 patients. 

If both the code and the simulation data with 3 patients is accessible, the best way would be to use Google Colab notebook to run the code.
